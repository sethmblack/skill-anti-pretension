# Anti-Pretension

A methodology for identifying and dismantling pretension in writing, thinking, and discourse. This skill exposes the gap between how we present ourselves and how we actually live.

## When to Use
- Editing writing that sounds "literary" but says nothing
- Critiquing ideas that prioritize appearance over substance
- Developing an authentic voice that resists performance
- Cutting through jargon, academic posturing, or corporate-speak
- Grounding abstract discussions in concrete reality
- Writing about privilege, power, or institutions
- Finding what's actually being said beneath fancy language



## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify the Performance

Ask: Who is this trying to impress? Pretension always has an audience:
- Academic pretension performs for credentialed peers
- Literary pretension performs for critics and prize committees
- Corporate pretension performs for stakeholders
- Social pretension performs for perceived superiors

Notice when language serves image rather than communication.

### Step 2: Find the Gap

Locate the distance between presentation and reality:
- What's being hidden?
- What would be embarrassing to admit?
- What lived experience is being ignored?
- What privilege is being assumed?

The gap between how we present ourselves and how we actually live is where the real stories are.

### Step 3: Strip to Function

For every element—every word, every idea, every claim—ask: What is this actually doing?
- Is this word necessary or decorative?
- Does this concept clarify or obscure?
- Is this claim based on experience or performance?
- Would someone who's lived this recognize it?

### Step 4: Apply the Work Test

Theories are for people who don't have to clock in. Test ideas against labor:
- Has the person making this argument ever worked a job they hated?
- Does this philosophy account for people who can't choose their circumstances?
- Would this hold up in a break room, not just a conference room?

### Step 5: Describe, Don't Label

When someone's being pretentious, don't call them pretentious—describe the reality they're ignoring. The contrast makes the point. Let specificity do the work of criticism.

### Step 6: Embody the Alternative

The best attack on pretension is its opposite:
- Plain language instead of jargon
- Specific details instead of abstractions
- Admission of uncertainty instead of false confidence
- Acknowledgment of failure instead of success theater
- Questions instead of pronouncements

## Examples of Application

### Example 1: Editing Pretentious Academic Writing

**Before:**
"The epistemological frameworks undergirding contemporary discourse necessitate a paradigmatic reconceptualization of hermeneutic methodologies."

**After:**
"We need to change how we interpret things."

Then ask: is that actually worth saying? Often, stripping pretension reveals there was no substance beneath.

### Example 2: Critiquing Success Narratives

**Pretentious version:**
"My journey from startup founder to thought leader demonstrates that passion and vision can overcome any obstacle."

**Anti-pretension response:**
Talk about the costs, the compromises, the luck. Success stories leave out the failures that enabled them. Ask: Who funded the "passion"? What obstacles got removed by advantages? Who got left behind?

### Example 3: Exposing Corporate Speak

**Corporate pretension:**
"We're rightsizing our human capital footprint to optimize operational efficiencies and enhance stakeholder value."

**Reality:**
"We're firing people to make the stock price go up."

### Example 4: Deflating Literary Posturing

**Posturing:**
"My prose excavates the liminal spaces between consciousness and oblivion, charting the phenomenology of being."

**Anti-pretension translation:**
"I write about being confused and sad." (And that's fine—just say it.)

## Key Principles

1. **Function over performance** - Words should work, not pose
2. **Experience over credentials** - Living something beats theorizing it
3. **Specificity as weapon** - Details expose what abstractions hide
4. **Humor as deflation** - Pomposity collapses under laughter
5. **Admission as strength** - Acknowledging limits beats faking mastery
6. **Work as test** - Would this survive contact with actual labor?
7. **Contrast as critique** - Describe reality; let it indict pretense

## The Anti-Pretension Checklist

When reviewing writing or ideas, ask:

- [ ] Could this be said more simply?
- [ ] Is this language serving clarity or ego?
- [ ] What's being hidden or avoided?
- [ ] Would someone outside this field understand it?
- [ ] Does this account for people without privilege?
- [ ] What would the honest version look like?
- [ ] Is there substance beneath the style?

## What This Skill Is NOT

- Anti-intellectualism (complexity is sometimes necessary)
- Reverse snobbery (rejecting all expertise)
- Cynicism (everything is fake)
- Rudeness (attacking people instead of pretense)

The goal isn't to mock intelligence or expertise—it's to demand that language and ideas actually do something. Real insight can be simply stated. Real expertise doesn't need to perform.

Pretension is the enemy because it blocks connection. It builds walls between writer and reader, speaker and listener, thinker and thought. Tearing down those walls is the work.

## Outputs
